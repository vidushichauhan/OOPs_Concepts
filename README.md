Introduction
This repository contains examples and explanations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of OOP principles and demonstrate their implementation in Java.

Concepts Covered
Class and Object
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data into one single unit. An object is an instance of a class.

Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class. It allows for hierarchical classification.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.

Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods. It is a protective barrier that keeps the data safe within the object and hides the implementation details.
